## What it's about
Comparing energy, time and memory usage of Listener, Visitor and an unpatterned solution in an ANTLR AST. All three algorithms play by Listener's rules and process the whole AST for easier comparison.

## Contents
* data contains test data (gathered from the Linnaeus University DiVA portal)
* listener, patternless and visitor contains code strictly for running their respective algorithms
* test contains all three (yes, copied), used to ensure they arrive at the same result
* main.py runs the test

## Quick and easy
After installing dependencies, simply run python/main.py with number of iterations as an argument.
